# YourCart
YourCart is a modern web application that allows users to securely track products in a personalized shopping list. Users can sign in using email/password or Google authentication, manage their products, and have their data persist across sessions using Firebase.
## Main Idea & Purpose

The main goal of YourCart is to provide users with a simple and secure way to manage and track products they care about, without losing data when they log out or refresh the page.

This project was built to practice and demonstrate real-world application development using React and Firebase, with a strong focus on authentication, data persistence, and security rules. It simulates how production applications handle user accounts, protected data, and cloud-based storage.
## Features

- User authentication with Email & Password
- Google Sign-In support
- Secure password reset via email
- Personalized shopping list for each user
- Persistent data storage using Firebase Firestore
- Data isolation so users can only access their own products
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
